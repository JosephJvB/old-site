### services that I will need:
- DOMAIN MANAGEMENT:
  - `GoDaddy`
- STATIC ASSET HOSTING:
  - [x] `Github pages` (seems to do what i need for now)
    - do custom domains for free: https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/
  - `google firebase` (maybe later)
    - uses fastly cdn which is what changelog uses: advertising works ay?

- SERVER HOSTING:
  - `NGinX`
  - `Site Host`
  - `AWS`

### Progression idea
- static html
- server rendered template (ejs)
- database (?)
